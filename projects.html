                        It is fully programmed in Java.
                        <br><br>PTS is a public transit card system that manages customer transit cards and transactions. The project has an admin and customer side.
                        The admins can create customer accounts as well as suspend customer transit cards or accounts. Admins can also view different statistics such
                        as revenue during a certain time frame, revenue by bus or train station, view the amount of traffic at each station, and other important metrics.
                        <br><br>On the other hand, customers can add cards to their account as well as fund their cards. They can also suspend their cards in case they
                        lose them. Other than that, customers can tap in and out of stations with their cards to automatically deduct the transit fee from their account.
                        This fee is calculated using the tap in and out locations.
                        <br><br>I was responsible for parts of the cardholder and admin classes as well as the cardholder side of the CLI.</p>

                        with NYC data to make the system come to life.

                        where players can compare statistics as well as share them with friends.
                        Players can also see all the latest in-game news and Fortnite Tweets.
                        On top of all that, they can see the current item shop and customize messages to send to their friends.

                    <br>
                    <p class="h3" data-aos="fade-right">As a board member of Computer Science Club at Stevenson High School in the 2018-2019 school year,
                        I set out to organize our school's first ever hackathon (24 hour coding competition). I worked to contact potential sponsors and
                        manage our budget, as well as speaking with teachers to convince them to chaperone the event. During the event, I collaborated with
                        the other organizers to manage the event and make sure everything was going smoothly by helping with the sign-in of participants
                        and meal distribution throughout the 24 hour period.
                        <br><br>The event was a success, with over 100 participants and over $9,000 in prizes, which were given to the top 3 teams,
                        selected by judges (professionals provided by sponsors) who picked them based on a series of criteria devised by my team and I.

                        three starters in Pokemon Diamond. The player can then fight other pokemon and level up. The attack damage
                        and hp earned are calculated with the same formulas as the official Pokemon games.
                        <br><br>As part of the team, I was responsible for all the graphics and animations as well as the Opponent class.

                    <p class="h2" data-aos="fade-right">An iOS app to help those with mental disorders.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="h3" data-aos="fade-right">MentalDrive was made during HuskieHack at Northern Illinois university. It was programmed in
                        Swift in a team of 4. The project won the "My Own World" award (equivalent to first place).
                        <br><br>MentalDrive is an all-in-one app to help monitor someone with a mental disability.
                        Based on research conducted, having a set structure is crucially important for those living with a mental disability,
                        so my team and I created a scheduling feature to make sure that all tasks are completed on time and in an orderly function.
                        To add on to this, many mentally ill patients are on multiple, sometimes several medications. We set up our app to where
                        the user can always keep a schedule of when to take their medications. Another feature the app utilizes is the behavior log,
                        which is preset with the most common poor behaviors that are the product of a wild variety of mental diseases, including
                        but not limited to Aspberger's Disease, Opioid addiction, and Bipolar disorder.
                        The behavior log will allow the guardian to give a description of what happened before and after the behavior taking place.
                        The relaxation section is the perfect place for when a patient gets overwhelmed and they need a place to go to get calmed down.
                        It has a music player, meditation assistant, and a game. We also have an emotion log. This will give the patient a set of
                        emoticons and they will select which one represents their mood at a given time. It also has speech-to-text capabilities
                        so they can learn and practice actually saying how they are feeling.
                        <br><br>As part of the team, I worked on the design of the app as well as the home page, relaxation page, and about page.</p>

                        It was fully implemented in Java. The purpose is to make it as far as possible without falling off the moving platforms.
                        Going further unlocks styles for your character, which you are able to customize in the home screen. </p>
